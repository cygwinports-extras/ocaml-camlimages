ldesc: "CamlImages is an image processing library for OCaml, which provides:

* Basic functions for image processing and loading/saving various image
  file formats (hence providing a translation facility from format to
  format),
* An interface with the Caml graphics library allows to display
  images in the Graphics module screen and to mix them with Caml drawings,
* A freetype interface, integrated into the library: you can draw texts
  into images using any truetype fonts."
